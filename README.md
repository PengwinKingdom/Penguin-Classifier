<h1>Penguin Species Classifier</h1>
<p>A web-based image classifier to identify penguin species using a trained machine learning model.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This project is still in progress. More features and improvements are comming soon.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project allows users to upload a photo of a penguin and receive a prediction of its species. The prediction is powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on images from 18 different species. </p>

<h2>Topics I Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How to preprocess image datasets for classification tasks</li>
  <li>How to fine-tune a pretrained CNN model</li>
  <li>How to build a basic web interface with HTML and Flask</li>
  <li>How to integrate machine learning models into a web application</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supports classification of 18 different penguin species</li>
  <li>Uses MobileNetV2 with transfer learning </li>
</ul>
