<h1>🐧 Penguin Species Classifier</h1>
<p>A web-based image classifier to identify penguin species using a trained deep learning model.</p>

<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project allows users to upload a photo of a penguin and receive a prediction of its species. The prediction is powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on images from 18 different species. </p>

<h2>🤔 How It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User uploads an image through the web interface</li>
  <li>The image is preprocessed</li>
  <li>The trained modelpredicts the species</li>
  <li>The predicted species is returned and displayed in the browser/li>
</ul>

<h2>✨ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supports classification of 18 different penguin species</li>
  <li>Uses MobileNetV2 with transfer learning </li>
  <li>Simple and clean web interface built with Flask, HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>Real-time prediction directly from uploaded images</li>
</ul>

<h2>📚 Topics I Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Preprocessing and normalizing image datasets for classification tasks</li>
  <li>Fine-tuning pretrained CNN models with transfer learning</li>
  <li>Building a functional web app with Flask and integrating ML models</li>
  <li>Creating user-friendly frontends with HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>
